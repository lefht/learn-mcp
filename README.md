# Learning MCP



()["open browser.png"]



()["results.png"]

## **What I'm doing**
- **Goal:** Capture a minimal, reproducible demonstration of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) example in this repo and show the before/after screenshots.
- **How:** I added two placeholder PNGs (`open browser.png` and `results.png`) that represent the workflow: opening the browser to the example page, then viewing the results after running the example.
- **Regenerate images:** Run `python3 generate_images.py` to rewrite the placeholder PNGs.

## **Notes**
- **Filenames:** The images are in the repo root. If you rename or move them, update their paths in this README.
- **Next steps:** If you want, I can replace the placeholders with real screenshots, add captions, or include a brief walkthrough that reproduces the steps to generate `results.png`.
